# SQL Data Analysis: Sample Superstore Sales

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Sample Superstore** dataset using SQL. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights by identifying trends in profitability, customer segments, and regional performance.

## 📊 Key Insights & Queries
* **Regional Profitability**: Analyzed which geographical regions contribute most to the bottom line.
* **Category Trends**: Identified the top-performing product categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture).
* **Shipping Efficiency**: Calculated average shipping times to find bottlenecks in delivery.

## 🛠️ SQL Techniques Used
* **Data Selection & Filtering**: Used `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` to isolate high-value transactions.
* **Summarization**: Applied `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `COUNT()` for financial reporting.
* **Logical Grouping**: Utilized `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to rank sales performance.
* **Table Relations**: Performed `JOIN` operations between tables to correlate orders with returns.
